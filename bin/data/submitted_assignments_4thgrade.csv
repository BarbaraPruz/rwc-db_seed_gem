Favorite Activity,awright,,9/1/2018,"Sweating, I walked into the gym. I was at Triple A baseball tryouts. All the kids looked older than me. Then I saw a few of my friends from soccer making me feel a bit better. I started warming up while my dad was signing me in. I heard the sweet sound of the bat’s “crack!” as the ball hit it…I wondered how well I’d do. Then, it was my turn to bat. “You better not blow it!” a voice in my head said.I batted. Getting only one good hit didn’t impress me. But, little did I know, I had been chosen. The coach would call me in a few weeks, and give me the great news. “Okay Billy, good luck!” It was my first game, and I was up to bat. “Ball!” the ump yelled. Faster than I’d ever imagined, two strikes, and three balls had wizzed by. It was full count. The pitcher wound up. He thought the ball fast, hard, but too low. I’d gotten my first walk."
Science Paper,awright,,10/1/2018,"I imagine my skies blowing up clouds of snow. I absolutely love the cold air striking my face. It is the best weather to ne in. Cold snowy weather brings bushels of fun. I love the snowy weather so much because down here we don’t get snow. The snowy weather also reminds me of Christmas which puts a big smile on my face. Even though it’s a long journey to where it snows, it’s worth it. The fun to have when it snows is endless. The feeling of waking up in the morning and looking out on to what seems to be mountains of ice cream. Being snuggled up in a dog sled getting a high range view that only happens at a special time of year it makes you feel as if you are in heaven. Snowball fights are so fun because when you throw one they don’t hurt and then the real action begins when you start climbing snow banks and hiding behind trees and when you’re just about to hit someone, wham! A snow ball hits you in the back then you fall over laughing. At the end of the day though, it seems as if it is the greatest time ever because when you sit down under the twinkling stars with your family around a fire. It is as if love has encircled you in a blanket of warmth."
Journal Entry,awright,,11/1/2018,"Do you know someone who would send their own child to die for the sins of the world? Any normal parent would say “No way!” Did you know that God did that very thing? He sent His only son to die for us, so that we may have eternal life with God in Heaven, Salvation should be a good enough reason to give your life to Jesus Christ. There are many reasons why you should give your life to Christ Jesus. First of all, we are all sinners and we fall short of the glory of God. The Bible tells us that. However, if we believe in the Lord Jesus as our personal savior and live and try to be like Him, we will have eternal life. You know God created us in His image and if you think about it He didn’t have to create us at all. I guess what I am trying to put into words is that God loves us so much and He gave us a gift. Why not take it. As you can see God’s love and grace are amazing and unchanging. He wants us to love and serve Him."
Story,awright,,12/1/2018,"It all started with a dare. “Bet you don’t have the guts to sneak down to the basement of the school,” Jackson taunted. I regretted my response the moment the words flew from my mouth. “How much you wanna bet?” We’d all heard about the basement of the century old building. It was rumored to be dark as a dungeon and smelled musty and damp. Up in our classrooms we could hear the gigantic old boiler churning and belching. It was like a big mechanical monster hiding in its cave waiting for an unsuspecting student to happen by.  Jackson grinned wickedly. “I’ll bet you twenty bucks you won’t do it!” He must have been pretty sure of himself. “Deal!” I said, thinking of what I could buy with that money. The question was, how would I do it? Student’s weren’t allowed down there. All day long I worried. Sweat formed on my brow and my knees felt like rubber. I looked at the clock. Five minutes until dismissal. I raised my hand and pointed to the bathroom pass. Miss Tucker nodded. I got up, grabbed the pass, and headed out the door.  I slunk past the boy’s room, casting a glance over my shoulder to see if anyone was around. The hall was deserted. I took a deep breath and ran toward the stairwell. Down the first flight, then the second. I hesitated. But there was no turning back. I took hold of the doorknob with trembling hands and slipped through the door. It closed behind me with a swoosh and a clunk. The sounds of the school disappeared as I entered this dim, mysterious inner sanctum. I crept down the stairs, sweaty hand on the railing. It was dark down there, with no light coming in except through the narrow windows along the top of the wall. Suddenly a coughing, sputtering sound stopped me short. It was followed by a huge whooshing noise-the boiler! At the same time a grotesque shadow loomed across my path and danced against the wall. A monster-like silhouette-huge head with wild hair, an enormous nose and protruding jaw, something that looked like a club clenched in its paws. I jumped back into the shadows, my heart racing. The shadowy beast shuffled toward me, closer and closer. I shut my eyes and held my breath, hoping against hope that I wouldn’t be detected. “Ahhh!” the beast hollered. “Ahhh!” I screamed. My eyes flew open. Mr. Mac, our custodian, stood before me, holding a mop, his other hand over his heart. “What are you doing here?” he cried. “You scared me half to death!”  “I’m sorry!” I gasped. “Jackson dared me to come down here. Kids say that…” Mr. Mac grinned. “I know what they say. That there’s a monster in the basement.” He winked at me. “I have an idea…” He pulled out a pair of scissors, snipped off a few filthy wet strands of yarn from the mop and handed it to me. “Monster hair,” he said. “Thanks Mr. Mac,” I answered, and headed up the stairs. As I opened the door I came face-to-face with my class heading to the bus. Jackson stared, wide-eyed. I held up the proof that I’d ventured into the basement. “Monster hair!” I exclaimed. “Time to pay up!”  Miss Tucker glared at me, took me by the shoulder, and marched me toward the office. But, seeing Jackson’s surprise made it all worthwhile. As I took a seat in the detention chair I dreamed about how I would spend my twenty bucks!"
Journal Entry 2,awright,,2/1/2019,"Different people have different ambitions. Some people want to be doctors, engineers and scientists while some hope to become architects, musicians and teachers. As for me, I wish to be a lawyer. I think being a lawyer is a challenging job. Imagine, going to the court and fighting for justice. I will stand for right and try to win the case. If I work hard enough, I will be the judge. I want to be a widely-known and famous lawyer. Not only do I want to be a lawyer. I will try to help the poor, disabled and aged people, If I want to make my wish come true, I must work extremely hard. I will go overseas, get a degree and come back to do my duty as a lawyer."

Science Paper,asmith3,,10/1/2018,"This amazing sea animal has a unique appearance. The horseshoe crab has a crusty, brown, hard, helmet shaped shell. The shell needs to be brown to blend in with the sand and to protect it from enemies. This sea share dweller can weigh up to about 12 lbs and grow up to 2-3 feet long. Its long spiky tail helps it steer and move. It also helps it flip right side up if it’s upside-down."
Journal Entry,asmith3,,11/1/2018,"A place that is special to me is Austin Books and comics or ABC for short. ABC is A store in Austin , Texas that sells a variety of things. ABC is a pretty small store,but it has really fantastic merchandise. Some things they sell are comics, books, toys, and clothing. Also, a lot of their comics are really cheap. Some are only 50 c!  They also have a few statues of super heroes. In the middle of the store, thier is a humongus statue of the incredible Hulk. Hanging from the cieling thier is a life size silver surfer. I really enjoy going to Austin Books and comics because it is really spectacular, and It is by a delicous restraunt to get dinner. If you live in a different town though, you might not get to go very often. Austin books and comics is probablly my favorite store and i’m always begging my mom to go. Those were some reasons why Austin book and comics is a special place to me."

Journal Entry,barmstrong,,11/1/2018,"Some mothers are the go-up-to-your-room-you’re-grounded kind, but my mom isn’t anywhere close to that kind! She’s everything I want to be, she works out problems, and she always has a happy-go-lucky attitude. To begin with, she’s everything I want to be because she’s healthy, caring, and loving. She’s been going crazy about the “stay healthy” thing, but I know she’s doing it for us. Next, she works out problems. Whenever we’re arguing, or I’m stuck on something, Mom to the rescue! If we’re arguing, she has us go to our rooms and think about what we did. Soon enough, we’re best friends again! My mom also has a happy-go-lucky attitude because she never yells (unless it’s absolutely needed!) That’s why I love her! I know my mom is the best, most perfect number one mther in the world!"
Story,barmstrong,,12/1/2018,"I held up my knee length nightgown. My mom held up my flece ankle length pj’s. Why should I wear those? “I said. Wear flece on a warm summer night in Montana. “It gets very cold in the night,” my mom said with a serious look on. I gave her a look, she looked right back at me for a moment there was silence. Then she let out a long sigh. I could tell I had won because she was putting away the pj’s. As I slid on my nightgown I could feel my mom herding me to my bed. I stopped and climbed in. I pulled up my light sheets. My mom opened her mouth and said “Put your wool cover over you, I’m serious!” I gave her a look. She let out a sigh. She hugged me and whispered in my ear “Good night.” I woke up with a tingle, I sat up in my bed. I looked at the clock, only ten minutes went by. I looked at my arms they were covered in goosebumps, so were my legs. It felt like it had dropped thirty degrees. I bent down and grabbed the wool blanket and pulled it over me with a sigh of relief. As I got comfy my mind soared. I thought about all the times my mom told me pack extra snack, I didn’t and got hungry. Or the time I didn’t wear rainboots when my mom told me and got cold. Then the time my mom told me to put on sunblock, I didn’t and got a really bad sunburn. But out of all my thoughts I wondered why I acted like that? Was I cranky or mad? But before I could think my eyes got heavy and started to close, before I knew it everything was black and then gone."
Journal Entry 2,barmstrong,,2/1/2019,"The thing is that ‘becoming’ and ‘transformation’ are very material- the body is relentlessly, often annoyingly, at times joyously, material. And I wrote The Spectral Wilderness from inside a body that in its transformation had me more honed in on what I could hold/ what would hold."
Favorite Activity,cspencer,,9/1/2018,"When kids grow up they want to be movie stars, pop stars and even astronauts. They want to have huge familys, but I don’t. The first thing I want to do is go to college. I want to go to W.S.U., Washington State University, in Pullman, Wa. I want to get a business degree. The second thing I want to do is open my own dance studio. I’d be a teacher and my mother would run the front desk. I dance at Debbi’s Dance Etc. I have been for the last 5 ½ years. Some of my friends dance too, and we think it is so much fun. The third thing I want to do is to get married and have a family, 2 girls or 2 boys or even a boy and a girl having a family is what I want most. Going to college, having a job that I want and having a family are the things I want to do when I’m grown up."
Science Paper,cspencer,,10/1/2018,"Where does the horse shoe crab live? In the salt water ocean and the sandy sea shore of course. The tall grasses of the marshes help the crustacean hide from predators there. These invertebrates also live in the warm waters of the Asian- Mexican seashores, I’ll never forget the time when I went to Mystic Aquariam to touch a real live horseshoe crab in its manmade seashore habitat"

Story,dcity,,12/1/2018,"Ugh! That hideous, and nasty graffiti on that wall! How can anyone stand this horrible art. Just looking at it sends shivers down my spine. Somebody has to send some operation to clean this up! (They did but I’ll get more into that later) And even worse it’s on a valuable school! Man, this school sure needs help! This is why, I think students should be able to improve their schools from activities.  To start with, if students will be able to paint on the walls, (leasureart not graffiti) it can do many benefits for schools such as giving schools a better look. You can brighten up the plain old hallways. Give it that spark of imagination and creativity that’s inside of you! Make your school a place where people want to be and make that visit pleasurable! Secondly, morals can paint messages. Such as courage, perseverance, etc. This could lift students spirits when they are feeling down. This reminds me of the time I started the school. The hallways were so dull I couldn’t even stand the place. What I didn’t know is that for the first assignment of the school year we have to express ourself in a moral. The next day a bomb of color set off Boom! Every inch of the school was exploding with color. Now this takes me to Operation Clean Slate. This operation started by a man named Michael Howard. I was at the edge of my seat when I read that Michael Howard’s operation helped paint more than700 murals. In the text starting with a clean slate and a lot of paint. Now that’s a spark of imagination."
Journal Entry 2,dcity,,2/1/2019,"I think dogs are the best friends a kid could ever have! Dogs make great pets because they are good companions and they are helpful. However, they are a big responsibility to take care of.  Dogs are great companions. Many are loyal, and will not disobey their masters. For example, my dog, Casey, always listens to my stepfather. Puppies are energetic and very playful. They love kids, and they like to play with them. Dogs like to play games such as fetch or tug-of-war. Whenever people are lonely, they could get a dog. That way, they will have a cuddly friend to hang around with. Many  small dogs like to curl up in their owner’s lap and fall asleep. (Dogs are really nice companions.) Dogs are very helpful. They are used in many jobs because of their great sense of smell and hearing. Fire dogs help in fires. They save people by going through an entrance that is blocked by the fire and leading the person out. Sled dogs, such as Samoyeds, race other sleds to help their owner get to a place he or she wants to go to. You might think a musher says mush when they want to make the dogs run, but they really say, “Hike!” Another job is that dogs can help blind people get to places without another person. They are attached to a special leash, and if the person swims, they have to swim, also. That way the person doesn’t swim too far. Visiting dogs also have important jobs. They visit hospitals to make sick people happy."

Story,jreid,,12/1/2018,"White pearly-seashells, relaxing under the shade, and playing volleyball? It’s the beach we’re talking about! Shiny rainbows across the beautiful shells… of course you want the shell! First reason I love the beach is that there is many different types of shells. Imagine this, every single shell calling out your name, saying, “Take me home!” But you better hurry up and pick those shells because they can go back to the ocean just because of a little wave. Ahh… just relaxing under the palm tree, with a drink, and letting your toes getting wet in the water…now that’s relaxing. You can always relax at the beach, no matter what. Another way to relax is to close your eyes, hear the sounds and take a deep breath. S W O S H! B O O M! Volleyball is a great sport to play at the beach. You can run, jump, and even at the same time in volleyball! This is why I love the beach… just forget the sharks and jellyfishs… think of the positive things. Relaxing, volleyball, and best, collecting shells."

First I need to get supplies at the hardware store like: a fishing pole, string, and bait. Bait is like fare fish that attracts giant and tiny fish. It help trick fish into eating it, but fish have a choice to be or not to be tricked. That why some fish are getting extint. Next I need to find a boat. Nice! There are so many verities of colors: blue, green, orange, and gold. I like the blue one because it matches the water and looks camoflodge, so no fish will recognize it. It’ll give me an oppertanity to capture a fish without it swimming away. Finaly I get to fish. Wow! I got a bite! I ganked with all my strength and the fish plopped out of the water. It was a giant fish. A fish the size of a tire.I put it in my bucket and brought it out to compare it with a different fish.the first one was bigger than the other. I threw back the other and kept the first one. Man! I am sweating because I finaly made a choice. I’m also proud of myself because I acomplishe my goal."

Journal Entry,kred,,11/1/2018,"Ronald Reegan, the 40th president of the U.S. once said, “ We can’t help everyone, but we can help someone.” I think he was saying that caring for others is important, and I agree.  To begin with, caring for others is important because you would want others to care for you. For example, last week I was on the playground playing tag. I was running along and steeped on a sharp piece of glass. The glass sliced through my shoe and punctured my foot. “ Ouch!” I screamed. Just then my friend Kirby ran over, helped me up, and walked me to the nurses office. Now anytime I see someone else hurt, I think of how Kirby helped me. In conclusion, if you want others to help you, help them first. There’s always something you can do."
Story,kred,,12/1/2018,"Suddenly feeling a whip of semi-pain, is what Catwoman’s whip is all about. Riding on a not so sturdy rollercoaster can get crazy if you go on Thunderbolt. The rollercoaster was one of the first ones built at the park, feels like you are trapped in a wild thunderstorm. It is amazing that the waterpark is the favorite part of the amusement park to so many people. Like my brother says, “ You can never get enough of the worlds strangest element.” Being slashed around the wavepool is exciting to try and swim through. A delirious rain is no match for the sprinklers at Six Flags. Sitting in an inflated life preserver, and being engulfed by giant waterfalls, really gives you the feeling of a hurricane. Lastly, the tube slides will make you want to scram for your mother, when you lie inside the dark tunnel, and can’t see a thing, until you get to the end. As you can see, being at Six Flags New England, can be the 3 d’s: dangerous, delicious, and of course delirious. So get ready for the mouthwatering food, exciting rides, and refreshing water park."
Journal Entry 2,kred,,2/1/2019,My little brother pulled the towel out from under me and I fell face first in the sand. The hot gritty  sand tasted salty. I could hear Sam laughing and I was getting madder by the minute. Suddenly I felt something moveing by my cheek. When I wiped the sand off my face I saw a nest of sea turtle eggs. Baby sea turtles were hatching out of blue speckled eggs. The minute they hatched they ran right to the sea.
